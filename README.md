# Poker-Now-Analysis
The website pokernow.club is a fun and user-friendly website that allows friends to play poker online together. It has become extremely popular for poker players during the COVID pandemic, including for me and my group of friends. 

During the pandemic, I organized a casual poker game that has started to run around 4-5 times a week. It has become a great way for my friend group to spend time with each other and have some fun together. 

Recently, I noticed that Poker Now keeps a log of almost anything that happens in a game, and provides the option to download a csv file of the log. As an aspiring data scientist, I thought it might be fun to analyze these logs for insights that might be interesting to me and my friends. 

So far, I have found ways to analyze player stacks and player nets as a function of time, and I hope to add more if I come up with more interesting ideas!

##### Update: 

I've now also added fun ways to display: player vpips, player post and pre flop agression rates, and the biggest pots of the night
